# README

This repo contains my Advent of Code solutions. Read more about it here: https://adventofcode.com/

As per the About page of Advent of Code, I am not posting my input files as part of this code. I believe the sample files are not restricted as such but if it turns out they are I will replace them with my own sample data.

I have tried my hand at Advent of Code in the past but never really bothered after the first couple of days. We'll see if I get further this time!

For 2024 I am using Typescript. I have thrown together a little folder structure that can be executed with `yarn ; yarn start` (in powershell, assuming you have yarn configured). It runs all the solutions in sequence and logs the answers to the console/terminal.

The folders are named per day, and contain sample data only. In order to use the real input files you can create a file in the day folder with the name `input.txt`. If the input file exists, that will be used. If not, it will fallback to the sample.

There's not a lot of funky code in here and I won't be trying to do super optimal solutions. It's not like this is critical software :)

But I will try to create clean solutions in easy to read and understand lines of code.
